// Spy specific stuff

// Cool shit right here
// Left click to shoot/stab, right click for invis/deadringer
// Mousewheel up to switch to gun, mousewheel down for knife
// Hold mouse5 to pull out and use sapper, let go to switch back to last weapon
// Press 5 a bunch to change to enemy medic and pull out medigun (to check what they are running)
// Press 6 to change to friendly scout (for cart pushing and being with your team)
// Press mouse4 to change to an enemy scout (small model+weapon for sneaky decloaks especially when you crouch, no speed loss, your actual hitbox does not change to match scout hitbox so snipers have to shoot above your scout disguise head to hit your spy one)
// Press Q to undisguise (quickly cap a point/cart / show your spychecking teammate you are on their team)
// Press mousewheel and scroll down repeatedly for satisfying knife animation (best part of the script)
